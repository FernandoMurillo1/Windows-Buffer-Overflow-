# Windows Buffer Overflow 

## Objective 

Windows Buffer Overflow Lab project is aimed to exploit a security vulnerability that occurs when an application receives more data than expected, causing it to full up memory space and even crash the program. With this vulnerability an attacker can run malicious code on the target application and take control of the system. 

### Skills Learned 
[Bullet Points - Remove this afterwards] 

- Advanced understanding in exploiting security vulnerabilities
- Ability to analys and interpert logs
- Enhanced knowledge in scripting languages
- Development of critical thinking and problem solving skills in buffer overflow

### Tools Used 
[Bullet Points - Remove this afterwards] 

- Script writing languages (fuzzy) to make payloads
- Virtual Machines to be able to make the overflow onto the other VM
- Telemetry tools to create network traffic and attack scenarios.
